# Preliminaries #
[Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) is used to generate the web-based documentation.  Pygments, epydoc, and docutils may be required for this packaged.
```
  sudo easy_install -U Sphinx
```

## Notes on the full documentation generation ##

The files
```
  source/conf.py
  source/index.rst
  Makefile
```
are generated by
```
  sphinx-quickstart
```
Along with index.rst, the rst documentation files need to be generated for the modules and functions in PyAMG.  We use [generate\_modules](https://bitbucket.org/thomaswaldmann/sphinx-autopackage-script/src) to automatically parse the docstrings to generate these files.  It is now included in the latest Sphinx repository ([https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/src/301426dab4de/sphinx/apidoc.py](here.md)) but is untested.

To generate the rst files, make sure that pyamg is built.  For example,
```
  $BUILD = ../build/lib.macosx-10.3-fat-2.6
```

Then, build the rst files:
```
  cd $PYAMG/Docs

  python generate_modules.py -d ./source -s rst -m 5 $BUILD build
```

To make the the web-based documentation using Sphinx and the generated rst files, use
```
  make html
```
