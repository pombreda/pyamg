This is a basic stand-alone SWIG example to familiarize the user.

To compile 
  $ swig -c++ -python splinalg.i
  $ python setup.py build
  $ python setup.py install --home ./

Then run testbasic.py, toggling between lusolve and lusolve_reference in
precondition.py.

To "SWIG" a new C++ function defined in foo.h
- Don't edit numpy.i
- Edit splinalg.i
  -> inlcude foo.h at the top
  -> instantiate foo as a templated routine at the bottom
  -> add any new parameter names for arrays that foo.h uses as  
     IN types, OUT types and IN_PLACE types
