"""Krylov Solvers

This module contains several Krylov subspace methods, in addition to two simple
iterations, to solve linear systems iteratively.  These methods often use
multigrid as a preconditioner to accelerate convergence to the solution.

Functions
---------
    - gmres
    - fgmres
    - cgne
    - cgnr
    - cg
    - bicgstab
    - steepest descent, (simple iteration)
    - minimial residual (MR), (simple iteration)
