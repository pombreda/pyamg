    '''
    Generalized Minimum Residual Method (GMRES)
        GMRES iteratively refines the initial solution guess to the system Ax = b

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : {array, matrix, sparse matrix, LinearOperator}
        n x n, linear system to solve
    b : {array, matrix}
        right hand side, shape is (n,) or (n,1)
    x0 : {array, matrix}
        initial guess, default is a vector of zeros
    tol : float
        relative convergence tolerance, i.e. tol is scaled by the norm
        of the initial preconditioned residual 
    restrt : {None, int}
        - if int, restrt is max number of inner iterations
          and maxiter is the max number of outer iterations
        - if None, do not restart GMRES, and max number of inner iterations is maxiter
    maxiter : {None, int}
        - if restrt is None, maxiter is the max number of inner iterations 
          and GMRES does not restart  
        - if restrt is int, maxiter is the max number of outer iterations, 
          and restrt is the max number of inner iterations
    xtype : type
        dtype for the solution, default is automatic type detection
    M : {array, matrix, sparse matrix, LinearOperator}
        n x n, inverted preconditioner, i.e. solve M A x = b.
    callback : function
        User-supplied function is called after each iteration as
        callback( ||rk||_2 ), where rk is the current preconditioned residual vector
    residuals : list
        residuals contains the preconditioned residual norm history,
        including the initial residual.  
    orthog : string
        'householder' calls _gmres_householder which uses Householder reflections
        to find the orthogonal basis for the Krylov space.
        'mgs' calls _gmres_mgs which uses modified Gram-Schmidt to find the
        orthogonal basis for the Krylov space

    Returns
    -------    
    (xNew, info)
    xNew : an updated guess to the solution of Ax = b
    info : halting status of gmres
        
            ==  =============================================
            0   successful exit
            >0  convergence to tolerance not achieved,
                return iteration count instead.  This value
                is precisely the order of the Krylov space.
            <0  numerical breakdown, or illegal input
            ==  =============================================

    Notes
    -----
        - The LinearOperator class is in scipy.sparse.linalg.interface.
          Use this class if you prefer to define A or M as a mat-vec routine
          as opposed to explicitly constructing the matrix.  A.psolve(..) is
          still supported as a legacy.
        - The orthogonalization method, orthog='householder', is more robust than
          orthog='mgs', however for the majority of problems your problem will converge
          before 'mgs' loses orthogonality in your basis.
        - orthog='householder' has been more rigorously tested, and is therefore 
          currently the default

    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from pyamg.krylov import gmres
    >>> from pyamg.util.linalg import norm
    >>> import numpy 
    >>> from pyamg.gallery import poisson
    >>> A = poisson((10,10))
    >>> b = numpy.ones((A.shape[0],))
    >>> (x,flag) = gmres(A,b, maxiter=2, tol=1e-8)
    >>> print norm(b - A*x)
